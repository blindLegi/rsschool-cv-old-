### About me:
Hello from Minsk! I have lived here since I went to university. I graduated from Belarusion National Technical University with a bachelor's degree in foundary production of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. In the last years of my studies, I got a part-time job as a courier driver. After that I was taken into military service for a year. The time I spent there...was fun! It was there that i began to think about moving into IT. And the last confirmation of this idea I received when I could not find a decent job in my specialty. But I still needed a job to live, so I went back to being a courier driver and started choosing what I wanted to do in programming. I decided to try Frontend and found rs school. 

So here I am - want to learn JavaScript (and all other stuff that needed along the way) and end my career as a driver.
